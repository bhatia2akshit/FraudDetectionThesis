This is a thesis topic that I did with University of Paderborn. This topic tests 4 different CNN based algorithms on different images and detect if there is a fake image present or not.

The algorithms used are CLIPBasedSigmoid, DIRE, DCTBasedCNN and Resnet50. The algorithms are present in src/Dataset1 and src/Dataset2. 

Dataset1: contains the real images extracted from coco dataset and fake images generated by latent diffusion and GauGan algorithms in training seet and real images of LSUN Bedrooms and fake images of bedrooms generated by Stable Diffusion and DALLE in testset.
Dataset2: contains the real images extracted from LSUN Bedrooms and fake images of bedrooms generated by latent diffusion and GauGan algorithms in training seet and real images of LSUN Diningroom and fake images of diningrooms generated by Stable Diffusion and DALLE in testset.

Results: CLIPBasedSigmoid has a good accuracy in detecting fake images in both datasets but bad accuracy in detecting real images. All other algorithms didn't perform as claimed in the works defined previously.
